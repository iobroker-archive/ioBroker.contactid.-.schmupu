**Describe the bug**  
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

**To Reproduce**  
If you have problems processing ContactID messages, I need the following information:

1. Manufacturer and type of alarm system
2. The ContactID message as a file. You can create a file if you activate it in the instance configuration.
3. The debug output/logging from ioBroker when processing the message
4. A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.

Without this information I can recreate the bug and would close the Issue.

**Versions:**

- Adapter version: <adapter-version>
- JS-Controller version: <js-controller-version> <!-- determine this with `iobroker -v` on the console -->
- Node version: <node-version> <!-- determine this with `node -v` on the console -->
- Operating system: <os-name>

**Additional context**
